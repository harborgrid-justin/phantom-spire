# Phantom XDR Native - Quick Demo

This repository has been enhanced with **Phantom XDR Native**, a high-performance Rust-powered extension to the phantom-xdr-core plugin that competes directly with industry leaders like Anomali.

## 🚀 Quick Start Demo

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the interactive demo (works with fallback even without native compilation)
node demo-xdr-native.js
```

## 🏗️ Full Native Build (Optional)

To experience the full 1000x performance acceleration:

```bash
# Requires Rust toolchain
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source ~/.cargo/env

# Build native modules (may take 5-10 minutes)
npm run build:native

# Build TypeScript
npm run build

# Run demo with native acceleration
node demo-xdr-native.js
```
