## Reporting a Vulnerability

The Phantom Spire team takes security issues seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### How to Report

**DO NOT** report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.

Instead, please report them via:

1. **Email**: security@phantom-spire.com
2. **Encrypted Email**: Use our PGP key (available on request)
3. **Security Advisory**: Use GitHub's security advisory feature

### What to Include

When reporting a security issue, please include:

- Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 72 hours
- **Resolution**: Varies based on complexity

### Safe Harbor

We support safe harbor for security researchers who:

- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations and destruction of data
- Only interact with accounts you own or with explicit permission from the account holder
- Do not access, modify, or delete data belonging to others
- Do not perform attacks against our infrastructure that could harm our service or users

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest version
2. **Secure Configuration**: Follow security configuration guidelines
3. **Strong Authentication**: Use strong passwords and enable 2FA when available
4. **Regular Backups**: Maintain secure backups of your data
5. **Monitor Logs**: Regularly review audit logs for suspicious activity

### For Developers

1. **Secure Coding**: Follow OWASP guidelines
2. **Dependency Updates**: Keep dependencies updated
3. **Security Testing**: Include security tests in CI/CD
4. **Code Review**: All code changes require security review
5. **Secrets Management**: Never commit secrets to version control

## Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication with configurable expiration
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Multi-factor authentication support
- Account lockout after failed attempts

### Data Protection

- Secure password hashing with bcrypt
- Data classification and handling

### API Security
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting per IP and user
- CORS configuration
- Security headers (HSTS, CSP, etc.)
- Request size limits

### Audit & Monitoring
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Security event monitoring
- Failed authentication tracking
- Administrative action logging

## Security Configuration
