# Phantom ML Core - Comprehensive Distributed Data Architecture

## Executive Summary

This document presents a comprehensive distributed data architecture designed to support the microservices transformation of the Phantom ML Core platform. The architecture addresses the unique challenges of machine learning platforms while ensuring scalability, compliance, and operational excellence.

## Architecture Overview

The distributed data architecture is built on five core pillars:

1. **Service-Specific Data Stores** - Database-per-service pattern with optimal technology selection
2. **Event-Driven Synchronization** - Kafka-based event streaming for real-time data consistency
3. **Distributed Transaction Management** - Saga and 2PC patterns for complex workflows
4. **Event Sourcing & CQRS** - Complete audit trails and optimized read/write operations
5. **Comprehensive Backup & DR** - Multi-cloud, compliance-aware disaster recovery

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Data Patterns Identified

From the analysis of the current Rust codebase (72 files, 10 agents), the following data patterns were identified:

- **ML Models**: Currently stored in HashMap-based in-memory structures with basic metadata
- **Training Data**: Simple configuration and result tracking without lineage
- **Agent Configurations**: Basic HashMap storage with limited orchestration capabilities
- **Enterprise Features**: Multi-tenant isolation configured but not fully implemented
- **Audit Logs**: Basic audit entry structures without comprehensive event sourcing

### Key Limitations in Current Architecture

- **No data partitioning strategy** for scale
- **Limited multi-tenant data isolation**
- **In-memory storage** with no persistence strategy
- **No event sourcing** for audit compliance
- **Monolithic data access patterns**
- **No distributed transaction support**
- **Limited backup and recovery capabilities**

## Distributed Architecture Design

### 1. Database-per-Service Architecture

#### Service Decomposition

| Service | Primary Database | Secondary/Cache | Analytics | Purpose |
|---------|------------------|-----------------|-----------|---------|
| **ML Model Service** | PostgreSQL | MinIO | - | Model metadata, versioning, lineage |
| **Training Service** | PostgreSQL | - | ClickHouse | Training jobs, experiments, hyperparameters |
| **Inference Service** | PostgreSQL | Redis | ClickHouse | Inference jobs, real-time predictions |
| **Agent Orchestration** | PostgreSQL | MongoDB | - | Agent configs, execution state, workflows |
| **Audit & Compliance** | PostgreSQL | Elasticsearch | - | Structured audit logs, compliance reports |
| **Performance Analytics** | ClickHouse | Redis | - | Time-series metrics, system performance |
| **User & Tenant Management** | PostgreSQL | - | - | User data, tenant configuration, quotas |

#### Technology Selection Rationale

- **PostgreSQL**: ACID compliance for critical business data, excellent partitioning support
- **ClickHouse**: Optimized for time-series analytics and large-scale data aggregation
- **MongoDB**: Flexible document storage for complex agent configurations
- **Redis**: High-performance caching and real-time data access
- **Elasticsearch**: Full-text search capabilities for audit log analysis
- **MinIO**: S3-compatible object storage for ML model artifacts

### 2. Multi-Tenant Data Isolation Strategy

#### Isolation Levels by Data Sensitivity

```
High Security Tenants:
├── Database-per-tenant
├── Separate encryption keys
├── Dedicated backup schedules
└── Isolated monitoring

Standard Tenants:
├── Schema-per-tenant
├── Row-level security (RLS)
├── Shared infrastructure
└── Tenant-tagged backups

Basic Tenants:
├── Application-level filtering
├── Shared schema with tenant_id
├── Standard backup retention
└── Shared monitoring
```

#### Partitioning Strategy

**Horizontal Partitioning:**
- Models: Hash partitioned by `tenant_id` (64 partitions)
- Inference Jobs: Range partitioned by `created_at` (monthly)
- Audit Logs: Range partitioned by `timestamp` (daily)
- Training Metrics: Partitioned by `tenant_id` and `timestamp`

**Vertical Partitioning:**
- Large model artifacts separated to object storage
- Frequently accessed metadata kept in hot storage
- Historical data moved to analytical databases

### 3. Data Consistency Models

#### Strong Consistency Requirements
- **Tenant Management**: User roles, permissions, quotas
- **Model Versioning**: Version conflicts, artifact integrity
- **Audit Logs**: Regulatory compliance, tamper-proofing
- **Billing Data**: Usage tracking, quota enforcement

#### Eventual Consistency Acceptable
- **Performance Metrics**: Time-series data with acceptable delay
- **Analytics Aggregations**: Batch processing acceptable
- **Search Indices**: Elasticsearch eventual consistency
- **Cache Data**: TTL-based expiration acceptable

### 4. Distributed Transaction Patterns

#### Saga Pattern for Long-Running Operations
- **ML Model Training**: Multi-service workflow spanning hours
- **Batch Processing**: Large dataset operations
- **Agent Orchestration**: Complex multi-step automation

#### Two-Phase Commit for Critical Operations
- **Model Deployment**: Atomic across multiple services
- **Tenant Creation**: Consistent setup across all services
- **Compliance Operations**: GDPR deletion requests

#### Transaction Pattern Selection Logic
```rust
match (consistency_requirement, duration_estimate, participant_count) {
    (Strong, < 10s, <= 4) => TwoPhaseCommit,
    (Strong, >= 10s, _) => Saga,
    (Eventual, _, _) => EventualConsistency,
}
```

### 5. Event Sourcing & CQRS Implementation

#### Event Store Design
- **PostgreSQL-based** event store with tenant partitioning
- **Optimistic concurrency control** for aggregate versioning
- **Snapshotting** for performance optimization
- **Event replay** for point-in-time recovery

#### Domain Events
- **ML Model Lifecycle**: Created, Updated, Trained, Deployed, Archived
- **Training Workflow**: Started, Progress, Completed, Failed
- **Inference Operations**: Requested, Completed, Batch Processed
- **Agent Execution**: Started, Progress, Completed, Failed
- **Audit Events**: All operations for compliance tracking

#### CQRS Read Models
- **Optimized for queries** with denormalized data
- **Materialized views** for complex aggregations
- **Search-optimized** projections in Elasticsearch
- **Real-time updates** via event projections

### 6. Data Synchronization Strategies

#### Event-Driven Architecture with Kafka
- **Topic-based** event distribution
- **Partition keys** for ordered processing per tenant/model
- **Idempotent handlers** for duplicate event handling
- **Dead letter queues** for failed event processing

#### Cross-Service Synchronization
- **Model Service**: Updates from training completions
- **Analytics Service**: Metrics from all service operations
- **Audit Service**: Events from all services for compliance
- **Cache Invalidation**: Redis cache updates on data changes

#### Conflict Resolution Strategies
- **Last Write Wins**: For non-critical metadata
- **Version-Based**: Using vector clocks for concurrent updates
- **Business Rule-Based**: Training service has priority for model updates
- **Manual Resolution**: For complex conflicts requiring human intervention

### 7. Backup and Disaster Recovery

#### Multi-Tier Backup Strategy
```
Critical Data (ML Models, User Data):
├── Continuous backup (WAL shipping)
├── 3x replication across regions
├── 7-year retention
└── Point-in-time recovery

Important Data (Configuration, Metadata):
├── Hourly incremental backups
├── 2x replication
├── 5-year retention
└── Daily recovery points

Standard Data (Metrics, Logs):
├── Daily full backups
├── Single region storage
├── 3-year retention
└── Weekly recovery points
```

#### Multi-Cloud Storage Strategy
- **Primary**: AWS S3 (hot storage, immediate access)
- **Secondary**: Azure Blob Storage (warm storage, geo-redundancy)
- **Archive**: Google Cloud Storage (cold storage, long-term retention)

#### Point-in-Time Recovery
- **Event Replay**: Reconstruct state from event store
- **Baseline + Events**: Restore from backup + replay events
- **Service-by-Service**: Granular recovery for specific services
- **Validation**: Automated integrity checking post-recovery
