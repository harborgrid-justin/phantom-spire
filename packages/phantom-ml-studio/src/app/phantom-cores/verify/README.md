# Phantom Cores Verification Dashboard

## Overview
This directory contains the refactored Phantom Cores API Verification Dashboard, broken down into smaller, more manageable files for better maintainability and code organization.

## File Structure

```

├── page.tsx                    # Main dashboard component
├── types.ts                    # TypeScript interfaces and types
├── api.ts                      # API functions for data fetching

│   └── CoreDetails.tsx        # Individual core details component

```

## Components

### Main Dashboard (`page.tsx`)
- Contains the main layout, header, and tab navigation
- Manages state for active tab selection
- Handles loading and error states
- Imports and uses the extracted components

### Types (`types.ts`)
- `VerificationResult`: Interface for individual core verification results
- `VerificationResponse`: Interface for the complete API response
- `TestApiParams`: Interface for API testing parameters

### API Functions (`api.ts`)
- `fetchVerificationResults()`: Fetches verification data from the API
- `testSpecificApi()`: Tests individual APIs with parameters

### Components

#### VerificationSummary (`components/VerificationSummary.tsx`)
- Displays summary statistics in card format
- Shows total cores, accessible cores, errors, and warnings
- Includes circular progress indicator for success rate

#### CoreDetails (`components/CoreDetails.tsx`)
- Expandable accordion for each core package
- Shows package information, enterprise features, available APIs, and test results
- Includes API testing dialog with parameter input

## Benefits of Refactoring

1. **Modularity**: Each component has a single responsibility
2. **Reusability**: Components can be easily reused or tested independently
3. **Maintainability**: Changes to individual components don't affect others
4. **Type Safety**: Centralized type definitions ensure consistency
5. **Code Organization**: Related functionality is grouped together
6. **Testing**: Smaller components are easier to unit test

## Usage

The dashboard provides comprehensive verification of all phantom-*-core packages, including:
- Package accessibility status
- Available API endpoints
- Enterprise features
- Test results and coverage
- Interactive API testing capabilities

Navigate between tabs to view:
- **All Cores**: Complete list of all phantom cores
- **Accessible**: Only cores that are successfully accessible
- **Errors**: Cores with import or configuration errors
- **Summary Report**: Text-based comprehensive report
